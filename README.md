# What works
- `podman pull --arch amd64 fedora` to pull a x86 fedora image
- `podman run --rm -it --platform linux/amd64 fedora` To run a x86 fedora coreOS image
# What I've tried
- There are numerous scripts online that pull a x86 coreOS image and then modify the configuration file that generated. Those are, unfortunately, for an older version of podman. I tried taking a configuration file generated by an x86 Mac and comparing/contrasting it with a config file generated by a arm and it didn't seem to work
- using the x86 images pulled above and tried to convert them into machines. Didn't seem to work, had the same error as the above bullet point
- Tried updating a old [script](https://github.com/laurent-martin/podman_x86_64_on_apple_aach64), stopped since the config files are different. The script is podmac.sh in this repo

# What I haven't tried
- using qemu-user-static, more about that in [this thread](https://github.com/containers/podman/discussions/12899#discussioncomment-1989842)
- a way to make the default target architecture amd64 "inside in the vm" so that it always pulls amd64 images
- Didn't get a chance to follow up with this [thread](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/16148)
